# Game Emulator Collector (GEC)

Client to have a unified way to launch games for different emulators. **No actual games or emulator code will
be hosted within the project for obvious reasons**

## Planned Work

* Fetch game files from the net
* Feed games through the frontend to the given console emulator
* Controller support
